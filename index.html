          <h6>Java - Object Oriented Programming</h6>
            <p>I have been working with Java since my senior year of High School. In my high school AP Computer science course we focused on learning the basics of object oriented programming with games. My first two computer science classes in college also focused only on Java. My freshman year in college I worked mostly with arrays, for loops, nested loops, encapsulation, inheritance, etc. We used these concepts to create different programs and games, most namely would by my clock solitare game that I created for my final project. This project can be viewed here at my <a href="https://github.com/dzdrum">github</a>.</p>
          
          <h6>HTML &amp; CSS</h6>
            <p>I have been working with HTML and CSS since the beginning of sophomore year. I took it upon myself to get a pro membership at Codecademy so that I can start to learn the basics of HTML and CSS to build my first website outside of the classroom.</p>
          
          <h6>SQL</h6>
            <p>I have worked on SQL with codecademy outside of the classroom. During my time on Codecademy I have learned how to add and delete from databases, how to execute queries to search through databases, and also how to join multiple databases together. I have been really intrigued with this coding language and look forward to a potential internship working with databases.</p>
          
          <h6>Ruby &amp; Ruby on Rails</h6>
            <p>My first exposure to these coding languages was with codecademy also. I started to learn the concepts of Ruby for my Software Engineering class.</p>

          <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>I have always been intigued by new technology. During my years in high school I would spend hours out of every week watching videos on the neweset phones and laptops hitting the market. I have seen the astonishing rate of innovation in the technology field and I want to be a part in it. I have been an apple fanboy since I saw the first Iphone debut in 2007 but was unable to afford and Iphone of my own until the 4s was released. After a few years of using IOS and MacOS I have begun to see the increasing competition and innovation from Apples competitors. While many people love the familiarity of the IOS software that sparingly changes with time, there is a platform that provides more control and more features. This platform is Android and while it may have been unattractive and buggy at its first release, it has came about with many great changes to make this software user-friendly. If you would like to know more about this software and its differences to Apple's IOS then please check out this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCjkBWtFTv8">here</a> </p>
          
          <h4>Athletics</h4>
            <p>In my middle school and high school years I actively played soccer. I first played soccer at the club level with Charlotte United Futbol Club for two years. Once I graduated from middle school, I then tried out for the Ardrey Kell soccer team. I ended up playing on the high school soccer team for all 4 years of my high school career. I also was the captain of the JV team my sophomore year. I had decided that I did not want to try and play competitive soccer for a college and so I now only play for the Phi Sigma Kappa recreational teams year round. I now go to the gym 4-5 times out of the week as my stress reliever from school.</p>
          
          <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>My first academic goal is to finish my undergraduate degree with a 3.85 or above. I am currently planning to stay in college one extra year to get my Masters Degree using the early entry program. I feel that this would greatly increase my chance to get a high paying job in Software engineering. I goal that I have been focusing on very much this year is getting my first internship. In the field of computer science there is no way to underestimate how essential an internship is to be ready for the real world come graduation day. An internship will give me the ability to apply the concepts I am learning in class so that I can understand them on a real world level.</p>
