          <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>I have always been intigued by new technology. During my years in high school I would spend hours out of every week watching videos on the neweset phones and laptops hitting the market. I have seen the astonishing rate of innovation in the technology field and I want to be a part in it. I have been an apple fanboy since I saw the first Iphone debut in 2007 but was unable to afford and Iphone of my own until the 4s was released. After a few years of using IOS and MacOS I have begun to see the increasing competition and innovation from Apples competitors. While many people love the familiarity of the IOS software that sparingly changes with time, there is a platform that provides more control and more features. This platform is Android and while it may have been unattractive and buggy at its first release, it has came about with many great changes to make this software user-friendly. If you would like to know more about this software and its differences to Apple's IOS then please check out this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCjkBWtFTv8">here</a> </p>
          <h4>Athletics</h4>
            <p>In my middle school and high school years I actively played soccer. I first played soccer at the club level with Charlotte United Futbol Club for two years. Once I graduated from middle school, I then tried out for the Ardrey Kell soccer team. I ended up playing on the high school soccer team for all 4 years of my high school career. I also was the captain of the JV team my sophomore year. I had decided that I did not want to try and play competitive soccer for a college and so I now only play for the Phi Sigma Kappa recreational teams year round. I now go to the gym 4-5 times out of the week as my stress reliever from school.</p>
